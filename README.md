This is the code quiz for the homework 4. I used html, css, and javascript to make an UI displaying questions with one correct answer. Other features of the quiz include access to  a scoreboard with user's initials and score, a timer for the quiz which subtracts 10 seconds per wrong answer, and a button to clear the leaderboard.
